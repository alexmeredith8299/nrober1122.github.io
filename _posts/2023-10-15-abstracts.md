An abstract is a short description of a paper or presentation that informs people of its main points. 
The abstract serves as an advertisement to draw in potential readers/listeners and allow them to make an informed decision about whether they want to read further or attend your presentation.
This CommKit article provides a guide to building an effective abstract for a paper or presentation.
